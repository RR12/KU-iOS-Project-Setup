# iOS Project Setup

This is my new basic setup for iOS project.
This is also my learning project. So you could find some mistakes from my code, such as my `VIPER` implementation,how I use `Swinject` for dependency injection, how I createD my base network layer with `Moya`. 
Please share with me you thoughts.
